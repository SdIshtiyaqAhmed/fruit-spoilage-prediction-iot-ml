## Project Overview

This project uses machine learning to predict fruit spoilage by analyzing environmental sensor data—temperature, humidity, light intensity, and CO₂ concentration—collected from an IoT-enabled cold storage system. It aims to help smallholder farmers and supply chain stakeholders proactively manage storage conditions to reduce post-harvest loss and support sustainable agriculture.

## Ethical Considerations

- Designed to promote food security and minimize waste.  
- Avoids use of harmful or inappropriate content.  
- Supports sustainable agriculture and social welfare.  
- Respects privacy and responsible data usage.  
- Encourages responsible AI and IoT application for societal benefit.

## Dataset

The dataset is publicly available and sourced from:

[A Multi-Parameter Dataset for ML-Based Fruit Spoilage Prediction](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/czz68d9fwj/1)

It contains 10,996 entries with the following features:

- Fruit type (e.g., Orange, Pineapple, Banana, Tomato)  
- Temperature (°C)  
- Relative Humidity (%)  
- Light Intensity (Lux)  
- CO₂ Concentration (ppm)  
- Spoilage classification label ("Good" or "Bad")

## Project Workflow

1. Data preprocessing and cleaning  
2. Exploratory data analysis to understand environmental impacts  
3. Feature engineering and selection  
4. Training and evaluation of machine learning models (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, random forests)  
5. Model deployment and validation  
6. Documentation and sharing of insights

## Results

The trained model achieves near-perfect accuracy in classifying spoilage risk and can be integrated with IoT cold storage systems to help reduce food waste effectively and responsibly.

## Usage Instructions
